# Panakeia
Prokaryotic Pangenome Analysis

Panakeia is a python-based tool for prokaryotic pangenome analysis. It is described in https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.02.433540v1.
Panakeia uses graph-based representations of the input genomes to build a complete pangenome graph. It then utilises graph algorithms on this pangenome graph to detect shared patterns of insertions, deletions, rearrangement and variants between groups of genomes in the pangenome. 
Pankaia can be coupled with Pantagruel (https://github.com/flass/pantagruel) to further highlight areas with shares evolutionary history in the pangenome graph.
